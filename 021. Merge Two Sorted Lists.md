<h4> Linked List </h4>
<p>
A linked list is a linear data structure that stores data in nodes, which are connected by pointers. Unlike arrays, linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations.

```javascript
var mergeTwoLists = function(l1, l2) {
    let dummy = { next: null };
    let current = dummy;

    // Here we analyze if both of LikedLists AREN'T empty
    while (l1 !== null && l2 !== null) {
        // Then the issue is if the first list ISN'T GREATER than the second one
        // That movement throught the nodes already order then
        if (l1.val < l2.val) {
            current.next = l1; // Attach the smaller node
            l1 = l1.next; // Move to the next node in l1
        } else {
            current.next = l2; // Attach the smaller node
            l2 = l2.next; // Move to the next node in l2
        }
        // See that into the 'while loop' that next part of the code plays a role
        // as some kind of iterator
        current = current.next; // Move to the next position in the merged list
    }

    // Attach the remaining nodes from either list
    current.next = l1 !== null ? l1 : l2;

    return dummy.next; // Return the merged list, skipping the dummy node
};
```
