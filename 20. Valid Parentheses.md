<h4> Stack Structure </h4>
<p>
Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out). LIFO implies that the element that is inserted last, comes out first and FILO implies that the element that is inserted first, comes out last.
</p>

- Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack
- Pop: Removes and returns the element at the top of the stack
- Peek: Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it
- Size: Returns the number of elements in the stack
- IsEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty


```javascript
var isValid = function(s) {
    let stack = [];
	// Stablish all the brackets and their correspondents
    let map = {} ')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '[' };

    for (let char of s) {
        if (char === '(' || char === '{' || char === '[') {
            stack.push(char); // Push opening brackets onto the stack
        } else if (char === ')' || char === '}' || char === ']') {
            if (stack.length === 0 || stack.pop() !== map[char]) {
                return false; // Return false if no matching opening bracket
            }
        }
    }

    // If the stack is empty at the end, all brackets were matched
    return stack.length === 0;
};
```
